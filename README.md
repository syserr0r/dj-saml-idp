# dj-saml-idp

This started as a fork of `novapost/django-saml2-idp`, distributed
independently as `dj-saml-idp`.

`dj-saml-idp` implements the Identity Provider (IDP) side of the SAML 2.0
protocol and makes user authentication available to external applications.

This package only supports Django 1.9+. At this time, it's only been tested
with Django 1.9 & 1.11

# Development And Testing 

The package uses a Docker container to support both development and
tests. The container creates virtual environments for different
Python versions as below:

* Python 2.7 in `/venv27`
* Python 3.7 in `/venv37`

These environments may be used for development and interactive testing.

To build and run the container, to get a bash prompt:
```bash
docker build -t dj-saml-idp:latest .
docker-compose run --service-ports test
```

To support use of IDEs (such as PyCharm) for development, the container
can also run SSHD; run the command `docker/run_sshd.sh` at a bash prompt
in the container. In the commands above, the --service-ports option is
only needed if you intend to run sshd in the container.

The test runner is `pytest`. For release tests, we use `tox` to run
the tests against different versions of Python and Django. The tests
can be run inside the Docker container using `tox`:

```bash
$ . /venv37/bin/activate
$ tox
```

Release
-------

First of all, create a new version of the package. We use `bumpversion`_ to
handle updating all version strings, committing the changes and creating a
new git tag automatically. To bump the packag version use the follwoing
command with whichever part of the semantic version you'd like to update::

    $ bumpversion (major|minor|patch)

for instance for a *minor* update, use (which should be the most common case)::

    $ bumpersion minor

You need the PyPI credentials for the `mobify` account to be able to release
a new version and the build script is expecting it defined as an environment
variable::

    $ export PYPI_PASSWORD=supersecretpassword

Releasing a new version to PyPI is very simple. The first thing you need to do
is make sure that all the test are passing and that the version in
`saml2idp/__init__.py` is the one that you'd like to create on PyPI.

With that done, all you need to do is run the following commands::

    $ make release

This will cleanup the `build/` and `dist/` directories, build a source package
and a Python wheel. Both will then be uploaded to PyPI.
